<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hi, I’m Pawan Tiwari, a B.Tech student passionate about Web Development, DSA, and Open-Source.</p>

<P> I love building useful digital tools, improving my coding skills every day, and sharing my journey online.</P>

<P>Currently, I’m preparing for internship, working on my portfolio, and learning to communicate confidently in English.</P>

<p>I believe in consistency, hard work, and continuous learning.</p>

<p>I love learning new technologies, exploring real-world projects, and sharing my progress through my YouTube coding journey.</p>

<p>Coming from a Hindi-medium background, I am also focused on improving my English communication skills—practicing daily and learning to express my ideas confidently and professionally in an Indian-English style.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy understanding how computers and hardware actually work, creating digital tools that solve everyday problems, and helping shopkeepers or students with simple, impactful software ideas.</p>

<p>Every day I work on being consistent, disciplined, and growth-oriented, because I truly believe:</p>
<p>“Hard work with the right direction always pays off.”</p>
